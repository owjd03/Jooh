we are team Joohfeed for lifehack 2025


**Installation (Windows)**
1. add `GEMINI_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"` in .env file in the root directory.

2. To run our backend server locally, we begin by setting up and activating a Python virtual environment.
This ensures that all dependencies are isolated from the global system and consistent across environments.
```
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Next, we install all required dependencies listed in our requirements.txt file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. And finally, we launch the backend by running the main application file:
```
python app.py
```
This starts our Flask server, which handles requests from the Chrome extension, processes product URLs, and returns sustainability scores along with supporting data.

Hello! We are Team Joohfeed, and I'm Teck Wee.
Today, I'll be showcasing our product â€” Jooh, a Chrome extension designed to make sustainable shopping easier and more transparent.

Jooh provides users with an environmental sustainability score for products they view on popular e-commerce platforms. This helps shoppers make well-informed decisions and avoid unintentionally supporting unsustainable practices.

What sets Jooh apart is its detailed breakdown of the overall sustainability score into six key pillars:

Carbon Footprint

Water Usage

Pollution

Waste Generation & Circularity

Resource Depletion, and

Biodiversity & Ecosystem Impact

Each pillar is rated independently, giving users full visibility into how the score is calculated.

To ensure transparency and credibility, Jooh also includes external links to reliable sources that back up our sustainability claims.
